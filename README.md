## Ideas
1. Pattern analysis in graph (For stateful technique)
2. Study the occurence of 1's and 0's in normal traffic and meaningful communication (For stateless technique - Counting the occurence of bits)
3. Disrupting timing covert channel by introducing random delay in packet transmission
4. Modifying timstamp of related packets
